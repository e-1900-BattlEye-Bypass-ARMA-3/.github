## 🔍 What Is a BattlEye Bypass?

BattlEye (BE) is ARMA 3’s anti-cheat system. It scans memory, detects injections, blocks scripts, and flags suspicious activity.

The **BattlEye Bypass** tricks BE into thinking **nothing shady is happening**, allowing you to run external or internal cheats safely. It hides the loader, spoofs memory, and masks execution — keeping your aimbots, ESP, and teleport mods off the radar. 🧠
